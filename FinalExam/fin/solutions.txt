6) (10 pts) Short answer:
If the data packet is transmitting at computer networks that is larger than MTU,
it will be divided into small parts and reassembled at the source destination. if the packet does not
fragment, the packet will be dropped, and an ICMP message will send back to the sender indicating the
destination is unreachable.


7) (10 pts) Short answer:
when a program receives an interrupt while running the code, it is going to be turned to either ready or
block state, and then PCB save the current process which can be restored later on. Finally, the CPU is going
to pick a new process to run.




8) (15 pts) Short answer:
Eliminating the ability to have a circular wait ususlly can be done by assigning priority to each resource,
the process that holds a higher resource cannot acquire a lower resource. Therefore, A wait for B, B wait
for C, and C wait for A secnario will not happen because C cannot acquire a lower level resource.


9) (10 pts) Short answer:
In order to form a TCP socket, we use 3-way handskae stategy:
1).the client sent a SYN packet to the server
2).the server receives SYN packet, and sends back an SYN-ACK packet to acknowledge the client's request
3).the user receives an SYN-ACK packet, and send back an ACK packet indicating the connection is successful


10) (10 pts) Short answer:
Given a system of paging without virtual memory, the MMU would look at TLB table where logical address is
recoreded, and then it knows the frame number of each logical address. Eventually, the MMU combines the
frame number with offset to form the physical address.

11) (10 pts) Short answer:
Here are three parts delay I would talk about:
1). Processing Delay: The time for the router to figure out the packet's header and where to forward
2). Queuing Delay: The time that a packet is waiting on the router's queue
3).Propagation Delay: The time a packet takes to travel through hops to hops(physical medium)

12) (20 pts) Write the code:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

template <typename T>
struct BSTNode
{
    T data;
    BSTNode<T>* left;
    BSTNode<T>* right;
    BSTNode(T val): data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

bool compareWithBST(BSTNode<int>* root, const int& val)
{
    if(root == nullptr) return false;
    if(root->data > val) return true;
    //In BST the right most node has the largest val
    return compareWithBST(root->right, val);
}


int main()
{
    BSTNode<int>* root = new BSTNode(10);
    root->left = new BSTNode(5);
    root->right = new BSTNode(14);
    root->left->right = new BSTNode(8);
    root->left->right->right = new BSTNode(9);
    root->right->left = new BSTNode(11);
    
    int val = 13;
    if(compareWithBST(root, val) == 1)
    {
        cout << "There is at least one value in the tree greater than the given value!"
             << endl;
    } else
    {
        cout << "There is no values in the tree greater than the given value"
             << endl;
    }
    
}
